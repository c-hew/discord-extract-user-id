# extract-user-id
## Run the code
Just run the code by using `python3 extract-user-id.py` or `py extract-user-id.py` in the intended folder with the files you want to extract.

I am not good at python 2 so I am unsure if it works on python 2.

## Expected output
<img src="/imgs/expected-output.png" width="300">

The user IDs will be saved in the same directory with 2 files (one with duplicates, and the other without).
"user_id_new.txt" and "user_id_new_1.txt"
